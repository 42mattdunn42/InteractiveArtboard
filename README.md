# InteractiveArtboard
An interactive artboard that utilizes network programming concepts.

I wrote all of the server code for this group project. This was a group project for my network programming class where we were tasked with creating a program that utilized socket programming. My group decided to create what we called an interactive artboard, which is basically a canvas on which people can draw on and see other what other people have drawn. Unfortunatly, it still has some bugs that could be flushed out such as not functioning when the server and client are on different machines, a zoom effect that can occur on the canvas, and a better solution to capturing what has been drawn.
